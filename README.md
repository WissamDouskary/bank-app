## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project is a **console-based banking management system** developed in **Java 8**.  
The goal is to automate the management of bank accounts and their operations (deposits, withdrawals, transfers) through a structured and layered application.  

The system allows creating accounts (current or savings), managing transactions, and viewing account details and history, all while ensuring validation rules and error handling.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java 8**
- **Java Collections Framework** (`ArrayList`, `HashMap`)
- **Java Time API** for date management
- **Exception Handling** with `try-catch`
- **UUID** for unique identifiers in operations

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The application is organized into different layers to ensure maintainability and clarity:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI/Menu)**  
   - Interactive console-based menu for user interaction.

2. **Business Layer**  
   - Handles account and operation logic.  
   - Implements rules for withdrawals, interests, and transfers.

3. **Utility Layer**  
   - Input validation (positive amounts, account code format, etc.).  
   - Helper methods for reusability.

4. **Data Layer (in-memory)**  
   - Accounts and operations stored in `HashMap` and `ArrayList` until program termination.
